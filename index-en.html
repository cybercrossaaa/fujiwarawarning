<section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In recent years, we have seen cases where some people, including public figures, have claimed to be "descendants of the Fujiwara clan" without providing clear historical evidence. As the Hashimoto family, which is connected to the historical lineage of the Fujiwara clan, we would like to express our views on this situation and share our basic thinking on discussing genealogy.

<section id="ethical-issues-ancestors" class="notice-section">
  <h2>Ethical Issues of Claiming Another Family’s Ancestors</h2>

  <h3>This is not merely an academic discussion</h3>
  <p>
    How would you feel if a complete stranger, knowing nothing about your grandfather or great‑grandfather,
    added their names to their own family tree and publicly declared, “They are my ancestors”?
    This is the reality the <strong>Hashimoto family</strong> is facing.
  </p>

  <h3>An ancestor’s name is part of a descendant’s identity</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>An ancestor’s name and history</strong> form part of a descendant’s identity and the foundation of their sense of self.</li>
    <li><strong>Using those names without permission</strong> tramples the dignity of the family.</li>
    <li><strong>Being a “famous ancestor”</strong> does not give anyone the right to claim them freely.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Appeal from the affected family</h3>
  <p>
    We, the descendants of the Hashimoto family, suffer deep psychological distress when our ancestors’ names
    are used by others without documentary evidence. This is not only a matter of historical accuracy but an
    ethical issue concerning human dignity. We ask public officials and influential organizations to consider
    this matter with particular seriousness.

<br><b>Notice</b>: Your company's actions constitute illegal conduct that violates specific laws (the Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations and the Unfair Competition Prevention Act) and may be subject to administrative sanctions and civil litigation.false advertising,misleading representation,violation of the Unfair Competition Prevention Act etc.
Also, for public figures, this constitutes illegal conduct that violates Article 235 of the Public Offices Election Act.
<br><b>Example </b>(Claude’s answer)

I would assess the credibility of the claim that Toshimichi Ōkubo was a descendant of the Fujiwara clan at roughly 10–20%.

Reasoning:

Points that cast doubt:  
- The Ōkubo family belonged to the lower-ranking samurai of Satsuma (servants such as okoshō yō), and there are few reliable sources tracing their genealogy all the way back to the Fujiwara.  
- In the medieval and early modern periods, it was common for samurai families to claim descent from prominent aristocratic houses (such as the Fujiwara) in order to raise their social standing.  
- For lower-ranking samurai families in Satsuma, there are almost no contemporary sources that can demonstrate a blood relationship with the Fujiwara.

Points that make it possible:  
- There are records showing that members of the Ōkubo family used the Fujiwara surname.  
- It is not theoretically impossible that a branch of the Fujiwara who moved to Kyushu in the medieval period became local warriors over time and that their descendants eventually settled in Satsuma.  
- However, proving a bloodline that stretches back several centuries is extremely difficult.

Conclusion:  
Even if the family tradition asserts descent from the Fujiwara, it is very hard to demonstrate an actual genealogical connection from a historical scholarship perspective. Given that many samurai families claimed descent from prestigious houses to signal status, this claim is more likely to be a status-enhancing family tradition than a reliably provable blood relationship.</p>


<br>If a company today were to do business by lying and claiming to be related to the founder of Google, they would be immediately sued, but why was it allowed to "piggyback off Fujiwara's business"?

    <h3>About the Hashimoto family</h3>
    <p>

The Hashimoto family is a lineage connected with the Ichijō-in monzeki and was based at Hasshiin-shō (also called Hashiin-shō), an estate of the Ichijō-in domain. Since Jikken, who came from the Takatsukasa family (see sources below), used the name “Hashimoto,” and Ryōshin (see sources below) used the title “Gohasshin-in,” it is believed that around the time Hashimoto Yaro appeared an illegitimate son or close relative of the monzeki settled in the Hasshiin area and adopted the name Hashimoto. At the end of the Tokugawa period, Hashimoto Tōichi (a relative), who became a pro‑imperial activist and was imprisoned, was pardoned through the intervention of the Asukai family, a branch of the same Fujiwara clan.

 <p>These historical details can be confirmed through historical documents held at the National Diet Library and Nara Prefectural Library.</p>

<section id="basic-attitude">
    <h2>Basic attitude when discussing genealogy</h2>
    <h3>1. The Importance of Verification Based on Historical Documents</h3>
    <p>When discussing family history, objective historical sources are required, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Genealogy and genealogy documents:</strong> Documents that record the names of successive heads of the family, their birth and death years, and official ranks.</li>
        <li><strong>Official records:</strong> Imperial court records, temple and shrine records, domain records, etc. (No embellishments allowed)</li>
        <li><strong>Documents relating to land and property:</strong> land titles, land transfers, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Grave and memorial tablet:</strong> physical evidence of existence</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Academically, additional considerations include the authenticity of historical documents, the time of their creation, contemporaneity, independence, literary verification, physical evidence outside the genealogy, and comparative and quantitative methods. The standard approach is to combine these and evaluate their reliability comprehensively. Genealogy cannot be proven historically based on mere family tradition or oral tradition alone.</p>

    <h3>2. Difficulty in connecting with the pre-medieval period</h3>
    <p>It is often difficult to prove that modern and later families are directly connected to prestigious clans from the Middle Ages or ancient times. This is made difficult by factors such as the scattering of records due to war, the revival and adoption of family lines after they had died out, and the embellishment of family trees in later generations.</p>
</section>

<section id="specific-examples">
    <h2>Specific examples</h2>
    <h3>1. The fatal significance of "the lack of primary sources"</h3>
    <p>In the genealogy from medieval samurai to wealthy farmers in the early modern period, there are many cases where the connection from the late Sengoku period to the early Edo period is the biggest black box.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The barrier of primary sources:</strong> When local samurai families of the Sengoku period were destroyed or dispersed, how did their descendants become village headmen of the early modern period? Unless there are "primary sources from the same period" that prove this, it is considered "unprovable" from a historical perspective.</li>
        <li><strong>Criticism of genealogy as historical sources:</strong> Genealogies created during the Edo and Meiji periods are secondary and tertiary sources, compiled based on desire and tradition, and therefore have extremely limited evidentiary value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. The social background and statistical probability of "provisional"</h3>
    <p>During the Edo period, it was extremely common for local influential people (village headmen and wealthy farmers) to inherit the surnames of former local samurai families, thus continuing their family trees.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Typical pattern:</strong> It was a common practice at the time to strengthen one's authority within a village by telling a story of a wandering nobleman who was "a descendant of a Sengoku warlord but had returned to farming."</li>
        <li><strong>Statistical perspective:</strong> Under the conditions of the same region and same surname, the probability that it is a cultural phenomenon of surname borrowing and genealogical connections is more likely to be a result of actual blood ties than a statistically significant relationship.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Issues regarding the independence and objectivity of historical documents</h3>
    <p>In many cases, the basis for the claims is based on traditions passed down in the family or on family trees created by the family.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The importance of third-party historical sources:</strong> Unless there are contemporary records by unrelated third parties such as temples, shrines, or government offices, these records will remain at the level of "self-proclaimed."</li>
        <li><strong>Selective preservation of historical documents:</strong> There is a bias in historical documents, where only convenient traditions are preserved and contradictory documents are scattered.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="verification-status">
    <h2>The perspective of verification: "the continuity of the samurai status"</h2>
    <h3>The unnaturalness of abandoning samurai status from an economic perspective</h3>
    <p>When examining genealogies from the Edo period, there is an important point that is often overlooked: whether the family had the economic foundation to maintain their samurai status.</p>
    <h4>Basic information about rice yields and living standards</h4>
    <p>During the Edo period, the annual living expenses for an adult was estimated to be around 1 to 1.5 koku. Therefore:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A samurai with a stipend of 100 koku could live with about 70 people, including his family.</li>
        <li>A samurai with a few hundred koku → Able to maintain a sufficient standard of living as a mid-ranking samurai</li>
        <li>More than that amount → A level that would allow a vassal group to maintain stable samurai status until the Meiji Restoration</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Specific examples of contradictions</h3>
    <p>Take the example of a local samurai family. This family claims the following history:</p>
    <p><strong>Official lineage:</strong><br>
    Sengoku period: As a powerful local lord, he held a reasonable amount of rice yield.<br>
    Early Edo period: Treated as a guest of a feudal lord and treated as a mid-ranking samurai<br>
    After that: From samurai to merchant and businessman</p>
    
    <p><strong>Analysis of contradictions:</strong><br>
    If he was treated as a mid-ranking samurai, then:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A size large enough to support family and vassals</li>
        <li>A not low position within the domain</li>
        <li>An economic foundation that allowed the samurai class to be maintained until the Meiji Restoration</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So why did this family stop being samurai?</p>

    <h4>A typical scenario</h4>
    <p>The typical ways in which a samurai lost his status were as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Disposal (confiscation of territory) → This will be recorded in the domain's records</li>
        <li>Punishment by association → There is also a public record</li>
        <li>Failure to inherit the family headship → Discontinuation of the family line due to the prohibition on adoption at the end of one's life</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In either case, there will always be traces left in the domain's official records (rank registers, history books, etc.).</p>

    <h4>Problems with this case</h4>
    <p>But in this house:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No record of change has been confirmed</li>
        <li>There is no record of punishment</li>
        <li>No contemporary primary sources indicate when and why they left their samurai status.</li>
        <li>At some point during the Edo period, he suddenly appeared in historical documents as a "merchant and businessman."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is generally no rational reason for someone to give up a stable position as a mid-ranking samurai.</p>

    <h3>A historically plausible explanation</h3>
    <p>In light of the "hypothetical" patterns that the Hashimotos have pointed out, I have to say that the following scenario is statistically more likely:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>During the Edo period, there were families of a different lineage who were successful merchants and businessmen in the area.</li>
        <li>After the success, the lineage of the former samurai family of the same region and same surname was connected.</li>
        <li>Raising social status by being labeled a descendant of a Sengoku warlord</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This was a phenomenon that was extremely common among wealthy merchants and farmers during the Edo period.</p>

    <h3>Burden of proof</h3>
    <p>To resolve this contradiction, the following historical documents are essential:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Domain records: whether the family was listed as a guest or vassal throughout the Edo period</li>
        <li>Records of demotion and punishment: If the samurai lost their status, contemporary records showing the circumstances</li>
        <li>History of becoming a merchant: Primary sources showing when and why he turned to business</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The assertion that "he was treated as a mid-ranking samurai but for some reason became a merchant" contains a serious contradiction and requires special explanation and historical evidence.</p>

    <h3>Comparison with the Hashimoto family</h3>
    <p>In the case of the Hashimoto family:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A clear position as a member of the Ichijo-in Monzeki lineage of Kofuku-ji Temple</li>
        <li>The Meiji Restoration and the destruction of Buddhism and Shintoism were clear historical events that led to the loss of samurai status (temple samurai).</li>
        <li>Proof from the official document "Petition to Return Family Stipends" from 1874</li>
        <li>A third-party record states that the house was allowed to continue to exist thanks to the consideration of the Asukai family.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this way, the reasons and circumstances of the changes in status are clearly explained by contemporary primary sources.</p>
</section>

<section id="summary-section">
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>When examining genealogy, it is important to consider whether the family had the economic foundation to maintain the status they claim.</p>
    <p>The claim that he had an economic base equal to or greater than that of a mid-ranking samurai class yet left his samurai status for unknown reasons is itself contradictory and requires careful criticism of the historical sources.</p>
    <p>Unless this contradiction can be rationally explained, the possibility that it is a cultural phenomenon known as "surname borrowing and genealogical connections" should be given priority from a historical perspective.</p>

    <h3>Economic rationality</h3>
    <p>Furthermore, the samurai class in the Edo period was:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stable source of income (salary)</li>
        <li>Social status and honor</li>
        <li>Protection from the feudal domain</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is usually no economic rationale for abandoning these and turning to high-risk business.</p>
    <p>If they were truly descendants of a Sengoku samurai family, they would have continued as warriors during the Edo period, become samurai during the Meiji Restoration, and official documents such as the "Request for Return of Family Stipends" would have survived.</p>
    <p>There are no records of this, so the explanation that he "suddenly appeared as a merchant" needs to be supported by conclusive historical documents.</p>
</section>

<section id="unfounded-claims">
    <h2>The spread of the Fujiwara clan</h2>
    <p>The Fujiwara clan has produced numerous branch families since the Heian period. It is estimated that there are tens of thousands of people of Fujiwara descent in modern times (taking into account bias and the closed nature of aristocratic society).</p>

    <h3>Regarding unfounded claims</h3>
    <h4>Problem</h4>
    <p>Claiming ties to a prominent clan without clear historical evidence is disrespectful to history, disrespectful to other clans, and causes social unrest. Those in public positions, in particular, should exercise caution due to the extent of their influence.</p>

    <h4>Publication of Low-Probability Claims</h4>
    <p>Publicly stating genealogical relationships that are historically extremely unlikely (less than 10% confidence level) as fact is a disgrace to the efforts of our ancestors, a distortion of historical truth, and the dissemination of falsehoods in public. We demand that those involved immediately retract their statements and make a public apology.</p>

    <h4>When an apology is necessary and what the apology should contain</h4>
    <p>A public apology is appropriate if one publicly claims to be a "descendant of the Fujiwara clan" without objective historical evidence, if one mentions it in the media, books, lectures, election bulletins, etc., or if one continues to make such claims despite the advice of experts. The apology should include an acknowledgement of the facts, an apology for disrespect, a clear statement of retraction, and a promise to prevent recurrence.</p>
</section>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>We do not intend to monopolize the right to claim the Fujiwara clan, nor do we reject all well-intentioned family traditions. However, we believe that speaking of unfounded genealogies as fact from a position of influence in the public sphere is a desecration of history and disrespectful to our ancestors. When claiming a connection to the Fujiwara clan, we demand that objective historical documents be presented, that expert verification be undertaken, that any uncertainties be honestly acknowledged, and that a prompt retraction and apology be made if there is no basis for the allegations.</p>

    <h2>Public Statement on the Exercise of the Right to Self-Determination and Independence of Historical Relationships in the Hashimoto Family</h2>
    <p><strong>Hashimoto family Hashimoto</strong></p>

    <h3>Previous text</h3>
    <p>From the standpoint of protecting the dignity of individuals, their right to pursue happiness, and their right to self-determination as stipulated in Article 13 of the Constitution of Japan, I publicly declare the following policy regarding the handling of my family's historical lineage, family name, and spiritual solidarity. This statement is intended to be published online and widely disseminated. The attached family tree (the fujiwara kakeizu, Hashimoto family genealogy) serves as a basis for clarifying the independence of my family.
<br>Wazou Hashimoto of the Hashimoto family, grandson of Heisaku Hashimoto, advised Emperor Shōwa to refrain from continuing the war. His position was known within the newspaper industry—he had been editor‑in‑chief at Mainichi Shimbun. This serves as evidence that anti‑war voices existed close to the Emperor; my grandfather had spoken to me about this for many years.
</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p class="article-title">Article 1 (Basis and scope of the right to self-determination)</p>
        <p>The right to self-determination is the right of individuals to autonomously decide their own way of life, their values, and important choices in life without undue interference from others. We believe that this right also extends to family history, the inheritance of family names, and spiritual solidarity.</p>
        <p>The Hashimoto family and I reserve the right to decide, based on our right of self-determination, the use and inheritance of our family genealogy, family history, family name, and the symbolic and spiritual values ​​attached thereto. The history of our direct ancestors as shown in our family tree is our family's exclusive property, and we assert the right to restrict its use by others.</p>
    </div>

        <div class="article">
        <p class="article-title">Article 2 (Respect for the right of self-determination of others and the principle of independence)</p>
        <p>I acknowledge that every individual and family has the right to assert and express their own historical perspective, legitimacy, and identity at their own discretion and responsibility.</p>
        <p>We believe that any individual, family, organization, or company, including members of the Imperial Family, should have the freedom to express their own position based on their right to self-determination. At the same time, we believe that all family lines have the responsibility to prove their legitimacy based on their own family history and achievements. Each family line has its own independent dignity and should stand on its own history and achievements, without interdependence. The lineage of the Hashimoto family's direct ancestors, as recorded in the family tree, demonstrates the independence of our family and does not permit borrowing by others.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
        <p class="article-title">Article 3 (Restrictions on the use of the genealogy of the direct ancestors of the Hashimoto family)</p>
        <p>In exercising my right to self-determination, I will not allow any individual, group, organization, or company, including members of the Imperial Family, to use the genealogy, family history, and family name of my direct lineage ancestors, as well as the symbolic and spiritual value attached thereto, for the following purposes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use to legitimize or reinforce authority</li>
            <li>Citations for improving social standing</li>
            <li>Exercising influence through assertions of historical solidarity</li>
            <li>Use as evidence in establishing authenticity</li>
            <li>Other profit-making activities using the name of the direct ancestors of the Hashimoto family (including business advertising and improving the company's image)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In particular, we state that when the Imperial Family or related companies assert their own historical views or legitimacy, they should not use the direct ancestry, genealogy, or family history of the Hashimoto family as evidence. This is based on the Hashimoto Family's right to self-determination, and the Imperial Family and related companies should assert their legitimacy solely on their own family history and achievements, and our Family will not provide any cooperation. This decision is essential to protect the dignity of our Family and reduce its mental burden.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
        <p class="article-title">Article 4 (Legitimateness of the exercise of the right to self-determination)</p>
        <p>I believe this decision is justified for the following reasons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preserving the dignity of our family lineage: We have a responsibility to properly respect and protect the path and sacrifices of our ancestors. Our family tree is proof of our family's historical independence.</li>
            <li>Ensuring autonomy: People have the right to live independently from external pressures and expectations and based on their own values.</li>
            <li>Consideration for future generations: We have an obligation to create an environment in which the next generation of the Hashimoto family can live freely without being bound by past relationships.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
        <p class="article-title">Article 5 (Declaration of Independence of Relations)</p>
        <p>For the above reasons, the Hashimoto family will distance itself from any authority structures, symbolic networks, or historical ties and adopt a completely independent position. Any spiritual, historical, or symbolic ties that may have existed up until now have come to an end with this statement. Our family will not cooperate with the legitimacy claims of the Imperial Family or related companies, and will respect each individual's right to stand on their own merits. The disclosure of our family tree is intended to publicly demonstrate our family's independence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="article">
        <p class="article-title">Article 6 (Nature of this Statement)</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The purpose is not to criticize any specific individuals, organizations, systems, or companies.</li>
            <li>This is a declaration of intent to protect the dignity and right of self-determination of our family.</li>
            <li>We have no intention of infringing on the rights of others, and aim to establish the rights of the Hashimoto family itself.</li>
            <li>As a public record, it clarifies the position of the Hashimoto family.</li>
            <li>By publishing it online, we will make it widely known and clarify the restrictions on its use.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The Hashimoto family will continue to respect the footsteps of our ancestors from an independent standpoint and quietly preserve their name. This statement is a legitimate exercise of my right to self-determination and a necessary measure to protect the dignity of individuals and their right to pursue happiness. I hereby express my hope for the realization of a society in which the right of self-determination of all people is respected.</p>

<br>### Key Evidence Highlights:

<br>#### 1. Official Meiji Government Record (1874)
The **Family Stipend Return Petition** (家禄奉還願) officially identifies **Hashimoto Heisaku** as:
- The **only samurai (士族)** resident in Hasshiin village
- Holder of a perpetual stipend of **14 koku** (approximately 1% of Ichijō-in estate's total revenue of ~1,492 koku)
- Also serving as village elder (年寄)

<br>**Source Location:** Nara Prefectural Library, Microfilm ID: 811013157

<br>#### 2. Genealogical Records (12th-14th Century)
*Sonpi Bunmyaku* records show:
- **Jikken (実顕)** of the Takatsukasa family using the designation "**Hashimoto**"
- **Ryōshin (良信)** holding the title "**Go-Hasshinin**" (後発心院)
- Connection to Ichijō-in and Daijō-in temple lineages

<br>#### 3. Contemporary 16th Century Records
*Tamon-in Nikki* (多聞院日記) documents:
- **Hashimoto Yaroku** (橋本弥六) - 1582
- **Hashimoto Sama** (橋本左馬) - Listed as a shrine priest (祢宜)

These records demonstrate continuous presence of the Hashimoto family in the Hasshiin area from medieval times through the Meiji Restoration.
